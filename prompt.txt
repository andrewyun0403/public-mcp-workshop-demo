Please create a data steward Node.js typescript project refer to @https://github.com/invariantlabs-ai/mcp-streamable-http/tree/main/typescript-example/server 

Our target database type is postgres SQL

This project will create server.ts:
- please clone the @https://github.com/invariantlabs-ai/mcp-streamable-http/blob/main/typescript-example/server/src/server.ts as base to edit.
- using Please refer to the requirement @/requirements.md  to create the features

index.ts: please clone the @https://github.com/invariantlabs-ai/mcp-streamable-http/blob/main/typescript-example/server/src/index.ts as base to edit 

package.json please refer to @https://github.com/invariantlabs-ai/mcp-streamable-http/blob/main/typescript-example/server/package.json

tsconfig.json please refer to @https://github.com/invariantlabs-ai/mcp-streamable-http/blob/main/typescript-example/server/tsconfig.json

The tool's purpose is to read a `.env` file to get database connection details.

The DDL query should be `SELECT column_name, data_type, character_maximum_length FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_catalog = $schema_name AND table_name = $table_name ORDER BY ordinal_position ASC;`

Ensure robust error handling for missing profiles and unsupported database types.

Please also show me the installation and execuation guide (npm i --save-dev @types/pg)
