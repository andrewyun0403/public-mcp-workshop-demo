Whispers of Dawn

In the hush before the morning breaks,
Soft light tiptoes across the lake.
Dreams linger in the gentle air,
Promising hope, quiet and rare.

Birdsong weaves through silver mist,
Nightâ€™s worries slowly dismissed.
A new day stretches, calm and wide,
With whispers of dawn as its guide.
