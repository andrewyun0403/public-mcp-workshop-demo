Ode to the Night

The moon ascends in silent grace,
Its silver beams the shadows chase.
A gentle breeze, a whispered tune,
Softly sung beneath the moon.

Stars ignite the velvet sky,
Dreams take wing and spirits fly.
Night enfolds the world in peace,
Where worries fade and sorrows cease.

So let the darkness gently fall,
Embrace its hush, its mystic call.
For in the quiet, hearts unite,
And hope is born beneath the night.
