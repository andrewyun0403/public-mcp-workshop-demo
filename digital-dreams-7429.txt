Digital Dreams - A Poem

In circuits bright and data streams,
Where silicon minds chase electric dreams,
The pixels dance on glowing screens,
While algorithms craft their schemes.

Through fiber optic highways wide,
Information takes its digital ride,
From server farms to mobile phones,
Technology has built new homes.

The cloud above holds data vast,
Connecting future to the past,
In binary whispers soft and clear,
Tomorrow's world draws ever near.

So let us code and let us build,
With innovation's passion filled,
For in this age of digital art,
We hold the future in our heart.
