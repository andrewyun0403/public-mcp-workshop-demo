Sunrise Whispers

In the hush before the dawn,
Softly sings the waking lawn.
Golden rays begin to creep,
Stirring dreams from gentle sleep.

Clouds drift by in painted rows,
Carrying secrets no one knows.
Birds announce the coming light,
Chasing shadows from the night.

Hope is woven in the air,
Promises that morning bears.
Sunrise whispers, bright and new,
A world reborn in every hue.
